### Usage

1. Register and log in.
2. Confirm your email by clicking the link sent to your inbox.
3. Create a new album.
4. Upload photos to your album.
5. Visit the homepage to view all uploaded images from all users.
6. Edit or delete albums, photos, or tags as needed.
7. Add tags to your photos.

### Access Control Notes

1. Public Access (Non-authenticated users)
   Non-logged-in users can view public resources such as photos, albums, user profiles, and tags.

```
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read on photos"
ON photos
FOR SELECT
USING (true);

```

2. Authenticated Users
   Logged-in users can create, update, and delete their own resources (albums, photos, tags).
   Users can only modify data where they are the owner (photos, albums)

```
CREATE POLICY "Allow all access to authenticated users"
ON photos
FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### This ensures:

Public viewers can browse content safely.
Authenticated users maintain full control over their own content.
No user can modify another userâ€™s data due to RLS enforcement.
